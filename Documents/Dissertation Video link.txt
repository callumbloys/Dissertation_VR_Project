This is an old demo version video. Since this video new content has been added 
a forced object scaling system has been added however it has issues with it 
also the controls have been inproved and the VR as a whole is improved.

The reason for not being able to upload a new video is hardware issues as 
I'm having issues with my computer that's not working and my laptop cant run 
the project as my VR doesn't work with my laptop, so until my computer is reparied I cant 
complete the new video.
